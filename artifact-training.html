    <h1>Sample Training Outlines</h1>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> A set of generic training outlines for teaching AI‑assisted workflows, including one beginner session and one intermediate workshop. Each outline covers learning objectives, agendas, exercises, assessments, and take‑home resources.</p>
    <p><strong>Who it’s for:</strong> Trainers, educators, team leads, or anyone responsible for bringing colleagues up to speed on AI tools and reproducible practices.</p>

    <h2>Problems it solves</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Lack of structured training materials for AI‑assisted workflows.</li>
      <li>Difficulty balancing theory and hands‑on practice.</li>
      <li>Need for consistent curricula across teams without exposing internal systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What’s included</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>One beginner outline: introduction to AI in workflows, template usage, ethical considerations, and simple exercises.</li>
      <li>One intermediate outline: deeper dive into data organization, advanced prompt engineering, SOP drafting, and peer feedback.</li>
      <li>Learning objectives, agendas with timings, exercises, assessments, and take‑home resources.</li>
      <li>All content is generic and free of proprietary systems or internal screenshots.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to use</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose the outline that best matches your audience’s experience level (beginner or intermediate).</li>
      <li>Customize the learning objectives and examples to align with your organization’s context without including confidential information.</li>
      <li>Deliver the training using the provided agenda and exercises, adapting the pacing as needed.</li>
      <li>Use the assessments to gauge understanding and collect feedback to refine future sessions.</li>
      <li>Share the take‑home resources so participants can continue learning independently.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="safe-box">
      <strong>Safety &amp; Responsible Use:</strong> The outlines are intentionally generic. When customizing, avoid including screenshots, data, or system names that are proprietary. Emphasize ethical AI use and the importance of not exposing sensitive information during demonstrations.
